# Figura 

This project was created for the [Chainlink Fall Hackathon](https://chainlink-fall-hackathon-2021.devpost.com/).

## Marketplace Overview
Figura empowers both the player and publisher by utlizing Chainlink's decentralized oracle network and Avalanche's POS blockchain. Avalanche is a fully fledged EVM blockchain with low gas fees (and is great for the environment and your wallet ðŸ˜ƒ)


### Contract interaction

Figura works as two different NFTs, the Game Directory NFT which is like a library of games, where each token is a unique game sumbitted by a developer, publisher, or studio. The other is the Figura NFT, which acts as a record of purchase of a game or game item sold in a given Game Directory NFT. 

### How to Submit a Game

### How to Access the Store

### What the Future Holds
The next things for Figura will be adding game installers so players can play the games they buy directly. I also would like to add a DAO that controls the mint of both NFTs. Having a DAO is a great way to continue to empower players and publishers while preventing spam and potentially insenstive content, while making it a more accessible marketplace.
