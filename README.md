# Figura 

This project was created for the [Chainlink Fall Hackathon](https://chainlink-fall-hackathon-2021.devpost.com/).

## How the contracts work

Figura works as two different NFTs, the Game Directory NFT which is like a library of games, where each token is a unique game sumbitted by a developer, publisher, or studio. The other is the Figura NFT, which acts as a record of purchase of a game or game item sold in a given Game Directory NFT. 

## How the Store Front Works


### What the Future Holds
I will be implementing a DAO that controls the mint of both NFTs. Having a DAO is a great way to continue to empower players and publishers while preventing spam and potentially insenstive content, while making it a more accessible marketplace.
